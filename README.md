This is a simple Task Management App built using Django. To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies by setting up a virtual environment and running pip install -r requirements.txt. After setting up, run database migrations with python manage.py migrate and start the development server using python manage.py runserver. Once the server is running, you can access the app at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. The app allows you to add tasks via the Add Task button on the homepage and view the tasks on the task list page.
